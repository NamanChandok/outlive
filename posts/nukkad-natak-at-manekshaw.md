As part of Angdan Mahotsav, on the occasion of the 13th Indian Organ Donation Day– Bhartiya Angdan Diwas, the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) hosted a deeply enlightening convocation in acknowledgement of the significance of Organ Donation in India, at Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi. 

### The programme included a wide array of events. 
The convocation started with the arrival of the Chief Guest- Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya and the Guests of Honour- Prof. S.P. Singh Baghel, Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar. They were each prevented with newly published manuals of their Organ Transplant studies. Shortly after this, the attendees were indulged in an intriguing discussion on Hemophilia– its symptoms, negative outcomes as well as some insightful research done by some of the nation’s most profound medical professionals, on how to minimise the effects of this inherent bleeding disorder.

Following this, was a grand ceremony in which organ donors were felicitated with awards in recognition of their noble deed and for becoming an inspiration to potential organ donors. It was truly a momentous occasion for all present.

In his opening speech to the attendees after the awards ceremony, Dr. Mandaviya emphasised on the fact that medical service is not merely a profession, but a duty for which many sacrifices must be made. He added that it is rooted in Indian culture to satiate our conscience and show compassion towards those who need it. It is our ‘dharma’, our ‘sanskar’ that must be kept alive. Hence one who aids another in need of help, is fulfilling their moral obligations as a human.
This sentiment deeply resonates with the G-20 motto of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ’ , meaning “ The World is One Family ” , hence implying we must treat all with the same love we’d treat our own blood.

After this stirring speech, we were shown a heartwarming film on how lost kin can be found through another– their heart beating inside someone else, even after their demise. Moved by the idea, we took a pledge to become organ donors for the better of our nation and the millions of people in need of transplant support. A beautiful song titled ‘ Angdan Karo ’ was played to keep up the rousing spirits of the audience.

Once the health ministry’s team departed, there were two  nukkad nataks presented before all remaining attendees. The first one was an enticing musical performed by The National School of Drama (NSD) and the second was a heartfelt Nukkad Natak called “Ahsas” on the significance of ‘ Angdan ’ presented by members of Project Outlive from Tagore International School Vasant Vihar

Project Outlive was also highlighted by the host as the first school campaign to have been a part of this honourable event, and was also awarded with a plaque in recognition of its efforts to promote Organ Donation via social media platforms, social events hosted by the team, as well as Organ Donation Registration Forms. In addition to this, the team was also commended on their splendid performance by several health ministers present as well as surgeons from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. This nukkad natak was also recorded and posted on NOTTO’s official YouTube account and garnered over 1000 views in less than six hours. It is deemed to be a resounding success.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, it was a truly enriching opportunity that has helped us all further raise awareness about Organ Donation in India– a cause of great import, and we are grateful to have been a part of it.
