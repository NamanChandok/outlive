On May 13th, 2023, a team of volunteers from Tagore International School  visited Makeover by Preeti Gera, a fashion skill training centre, to conduct a sensitization program on organ donation. The aim of the program was to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation and encourage people to register as organ donors.

Makeover by Preeti Gera is a popular fashion skill training centre located in Bhera Enclave, New Delhi. The centre provides courses on various aspects of fashion design, hair styling, makeup, and other related skills. The owner, Preeti Gera, is a well-known personality in the fashion industry and has a large following on social media.

### Interactive Presentation:
Upon arrival, our team was welcomed by the staff and participants of Makeover by Preeti Gera. We conducted an interactive presentation on organ donation, covering topics such as the need for organ donors, the process of organ donation, and the impact of organ donation on society. The audience was very receptive and engaged, asking questions and sharing their own experiences related to organ donation.

### Observations:
During the sensitization program, we observed that the participants at Makeover by Preeti Gera were highly interactive and engaged. They asked pertinent questions and showed a keen interest in learning more about organ donation. We also noted that the owner of the institution, Preeti Gera, was deeply moved by the program and decided to follow our organization on Instagram. She also posted about the program on her Instagram story, which has over 6 lakh followers.

### Enthusiasm for Registration:
The participants at Makeover by Preeti Gera were very enthusiastic about registering as organ donors. They asked for our organization's social media handles and the website of NOTTO, where they could register as organ donors. We provided them with the necessary information and support to register as organ donors, which they did with great enthusiasm.
