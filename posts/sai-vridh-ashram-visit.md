On 13th May, 2023. A team of volunteers from Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar visited Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home, a residential facility for elderly individuals. The aim of the visit was to interact with the residents, understand their living conditions, and offer our support in any way possible.

Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home is located in a socially and economically backward area, where many of the residents struggle to make ends meet. The home provides a safe and comfortable living environment for elderly individuals who are unable to support themselves due to financial or social reasons.

# Activities
### Interaction with Residents:
Upon arrival, our team was warmly greeted by the staff and residents of Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home. We spent several hours interacting with the elderly individuals, listening to their life stories, and sharing our own experiences. It was heartening to see that despite the many challenges they faced, all the residents were positive, optimistic, and had a zest for life.

### Observations:
During our visit, we observed that the living conditions at Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home were basic but clean. The facilities were limited, and the staff was doing their best to provide the residents with a comfortable living environment. We also noted that the residents had limited access to medical care and basic amenities such as reading glasses, hearing aids, and walking aids.

### Generosity of the Residents:
Despite their limited resources, the residents of Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home displayed incredible generosity towards our team. One lady, in particular, came forward and gave us a pen when we needed one, even though she herself had very little possessions. This act of kindness was a testament to the selflessness and compassion of the residents.

We were impressed by the positivity and resilience displayed by the residents, despite their circumstances. Moving forward, we plan to support Sai Vridh Aashram Old Age Home in any way possible, including organizing donation drives for basic amenities and medical supplies.
