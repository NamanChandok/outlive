On 4th May “23, we conducted an organ donation awareness session at Aarya Mahila Samaj, an old age home. The aim of the session was to educate and raise awareness about organ donation among the elderly residents of the home under the aegis of our school project, “Outlive Yourself”. We informed them about all the lives they can help save by pledging their organs. We also dispelled several myths and misconceptions regarding the topic. Our team from Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar was accompanied by representatives from the National Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO).

# Activities
### Interactive Session:
The session began with an interactive discussion, where the students had the opportunity to learn about the residents' daily activities, interests, and concerns. This exchange allowed me to establish a warm rapport with them and understand their perspective on organ donation.

### Tambola:
To create a lively atmosphere and encourage participation, we organized a game of tambola. The residents enthusiastically took part, enjoying the excitement and camaraderie. The game not only brought smiles to their faces but also served as a platform to initiate conversations about the importance of organ donation. All the winners received prizes, such as mugs, glassware, and cutlery.

### Musical Session:
Music has the power to unite and uplift spirits. We sang a variety of Hindi songs together, reminiscing about old melodies and creating an atmosphere of joy. The familiar tunes struck a chord with the residents, making the session more enjoyable and memorable.

### Play on Organ Donation:
As a visual and dramatic representation of the significance of organ donation, we performed a short play. 

### Signing Pledge Forms:
The culmination of the session involved distributing organ donation pledge forms to the residents. Explaining the importance of their commitment, We encouraged them to consider becoming organ donors and explained the process involved. Many participants enthusiastically filled out the forms, expressing their willingness to contribute to this noble cause.

By combining various activities such as interactive discussions, games, music, and play, we engaged the elderly residents and effectively conveyed the message of organ donation. The session not only educated the participants but also left a lasting impact on their understanding and perception of this life-saving practice.
