On the 13th of May, 2023, a team from Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar, conducted a sensitization program at Radisson BLU, a five-star hotel in Dwarka. The aim of the program was to create awareness about organ donation and encourage individuals to pledge their organs.

Organ donation is a crucial issue that affects millions of people around the world. Despite the critical need for organ donors, there is a significant shortage of donors, leading to unnecessary deaths and suffering. The sensitization program aimed to educate individuals about the importance of organ donation and encourage them to take action.

### Presentation:
The team from Tagore International School delivered a presentation on organ donation, explaining the need for donors and the impact that organ donation can have on people's lives. The presentation was well received by the audience, and many individuals expressed interest in becoming organ donors.

### Interaction with Audience:
After the presentation, the team interacted with the audience, answering their questions and addressing their concerns. The audience was enthusiastic and engaged, and many individuals filled out pledge forms to become organ donors.

### Observations:
During the program, the team observed that the audience was receptive to the message of organ donation. The staff at Radisson BLU was also supportive of the program, providing a comfortable and conducive environment for the presentation. Additionally, the team was treated to an exquisite lunch, which was appreciated by everyone.

# Acknowledgments:
On behalf of the team, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Puneet Chaudhary for his support and for giving us the opportunity to hold the sensitization program at Radisson BLU. We would also like to thank the staff at Radisson BLU for their support and for providing a comfortable environment for the program.

# Conclusion
Today was a day of contrasts as we visited an economically backward old age home, a modern and well-equipped fashion training center, and a luxurious five-star hotel as part of our Outlive Yourself Project. These experiences helped us to understand the issue of organ donation from different perspectives and reminded us of the importance of empathy, compassion, and spreading awareness about organ donation.

Our visit to the old age home was a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by the elderly in economically backward areas. Despite the difficult circumstances, the residents showed warmth and hospitality, and we were touched by their kindness. One particular instance that stood out was when a poor lady, who had next to nothing, donated us a pen because we couldn't find one. It was a small gesture, but it highlighted the humility and compassion that we found in the people we met. Additionally, we were impressed by the residents' literacy level and their eagerness to learn and improve themselves.

Our presentation at the fashion training center was a success, and we were pleased to see the enthusiasm and interest shown by the students and staff. The makeup academy was a well-equipped facility, and it was an excellent opportunity to spread awareness about organ donation. The engaging discussions we had on the importance of organ donation and the misconceptions around it were insightful. We hope that our presentation inspired the students and staff to become ambassadors of the Outlive Yourself Project and spread awareness about organ donation in their communities.

Our presentation at the Radisson BLU hotel was a privilege, and we extend our thanks to Mr. Chaudhary for giving us the opportunity to present to him and his staff members. The audience was attentive and engaged, and the questions and discussions that followed were insightful. We were heartened to see the interest and support of the hotel staff towards organ donation. The contrast between the economically backward old age home and the luxurious Radisson BLU hotel was stark, but it was a reminder that organ donation is a cause that transcends socio-economic boundaries and unites people from all walks of life.

In conclusion, our visits to the old age home, makeup academy, and Radisson BLU hotel were meaningful experiences that reinforced the importance of spreading awareness about organ donation. The kindness, humility, and eagerness to learn shown by the residents at the old age home, the enthusiasm and interest of the students and staff at the fashion training center, and the support and engagement of the audience at the Radisson BLU hotel were inspiring. We are grateful for the opportunities provided to us and look forward to continuing our efforts to make a positive impact on society through the Outlive Yourself Project.
